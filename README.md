# Train Stop Item Color

## Overview

* Do you like colouring your train stop to match the item they transfer?

* Do you keep having to open the [train colours cheat sheet](https://factoriocheatsheet.com/#train-colors) when colouring your stops?

* Maybe you keep a blueprint book full of coloured train stops or trains.

Well do I have a mod for you!  

This mod automatically colours train stops based on the `[item=...]` tags in their names.  

Each item’s average colour is pre‑calculated and included in the mod, and a vibrance boosting algorithm enhances the final result.  You can fine‑tune the vibrance and saturation directly in the mod settings.  

## How to Use

Select the Train Stop Color Tool from the shortcut bar, then drag over any train stops you want to colour.  
All selected stops will instantly update their colour to match the items referenced in their names.

## Feedback & Requests

If you notice any wrong/missing colours toss a message in the discussions.  
I don't plan to add other mods unless I am playing them but if you want to generate your own colours the script I used can be found [here](https://github.com/RiskyKen).
